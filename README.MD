## SBU compiler design final project.

In order to run project having **java** installed: 
  

 1. Put .cool app, compiler-phase3.jar and table.npt ( available at parser package) in a directory 
 2.  Run the program by following command: 
 
           java -jar compiler-phase3.jar --input [YOUR_IBPUT_FILE_DIR] --output [OUTPUT_FILE_DIR] --table [TABLE DIR]

the output will be a set of MIPS architecture (32 bits) instructions which can be tested and verified using qtspim.
